The red banner is coming from Vercel’s configuration validator. It’s telling you that your vercel.json file defines both a top-level functions section and a builds array—even though Vercel’s schema only allows one or the other, never both, in the same file.

When Vercel detects this clash it aborts the deployment with the exact message you see: “The functions property cannot be used in conjunction with the builds property. Please remove one of them.”

Why the two keys are mutually exclusive
builds (legacy) defines how files should be built into either static assets or Serverless Functions by pointing each file at a builder such as @vercel/node or @vercel/python. 
Vercel

functions (newer) is a convenience shortcut that lets you tweak limits—memory, maxDuration, etc.—for automatically detected Serverless Function files. It assumes Vercel’s default File-System-Routing and doesn’t work if you manually list builders under builds.

Because the two approaches configure the same runtime in incompatible ways, Vercel forces you to pick one.

How to fix
1 — If you want custom builders (keep builds, drop functions)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "api/**/*.ts", "use": "@vercel/node" },
    { "src": "frontend/package.json", "use": "@vercel/next" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/$1.ts" }
  ]
}
Remove the entire functions block.
Use per-file builder config for any memory / duration needs instead (e.g. "use": "@vercel/node@2.13.0", "config": { "maxDuration": 60 }).

2 — If you’re happy with Vercel’s automatic builders (keep functions, drop builds)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.[jt]s": { "maxDuration": 60, "memory": 1024 }
  },
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/$1.js" }
  ]
}
Delete the builds array.
All files under api/ (or /pages/api for Next.js) will be treated as Node Serverless Functions, and you only override limits where needed.

Quick checklist before you redeploy
Commit the updated vercel.json with only one of the keys.

Push → Vercel will trigger a fresh build; the error banner should disappear.

Open the build logs—any remaining issues will be unrelated (package installs, env vars, etc.).

Once the conflicting key is removed, the deployment should proceed normally.
